=================================

LiquidFeedback polish translation.

I've took the sources for translation from LiquidFeedback (http://www.public-software-group.org/liquid_feedback) repository: 

1. files in help folder: http://www.public-software-group.org/mercurial/liquid_feedback_frontend/file/795eea4eff96/locale/help
2. translations.xx.lua: http://www.public-software-group.org/mercurial/liquid_feedback_frontend/file/795eea4eff96/locale/

I'm preparing open and free for everyone polish translation of LiquidFeedback locales. 
I'm going to add it to LiquidFeedback repository when I get access (CLA has already been sent and I'm waiting for permission).

You can join me and help to prepare better translation!

I publish my LiquidFeedback polish translation under the MIT/X11-License, the same therms as LiquidFeedback (http://www.public-software-group.org/mercurial/liquid_feedback_frontend/file/795eea4eff96/LICENSE)
